    <title>Challenge: Write a Poem</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1> 2 - 0 Livescore</h1> 
   <h3> Born a Nigerian!</h3> 
 <p>
You're already 1 - 0 down, no caps, <br>  
The cry at childbirth—Gen Z calls it a suss. <br>  
A loss already, just for being born here.  <br> 
<br>

Born and raised poor?  <br>
Forget middle class illusions, it's rich or nothing.  <br>
Take a seat if you must,  <br>
But the score is already <strong>2 - 0</strong> , no caps.  <br>
<br>

They feed you lies? Burn off the fat,  <br>
You must be tough. <br> 
Where others put in one, <br> 
You must put in ten.  <br>
And it’s not for luxury, <br> 
Just to earn a place in the game of life.  <br>
<br>

When they sit, you must stand,  <br>
When they crawl, you must run.  <br>
For in my 30’s, I’ve learned,  <br>
This life’s no fair match, but play you must. <br>
<br>

Trust yourself, don’t doubt the drive,  <br>
It's not over until the final whistle sounds. <br> 
"They think it’s all over... it is now!"  <br>
It’s a goal!!!... <em>Who scored</em> ?
 </p>
    <h3>I AM ROOTING FOR YOU, YES YOU</h3>
